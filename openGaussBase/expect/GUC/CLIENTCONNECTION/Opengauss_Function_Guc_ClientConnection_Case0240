-- @testpoint: 使用ALTER SYSTEM SET 方法设置参数dynamic_library_path，合理报错
ALTER SYSTEM SET dynamic_library_path = '/home';
?.*ERROR: unsupport parameter: dynamic_library_path
ALTER SYSTEM SET only support POSTMASTER-level, SIGHUP-level and BACKEND-level guc variable,
and it must be allowed to set in postgresql.conf.
--no need to clean
